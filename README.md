# CineInfo

This is a Ruby on Rails application that gets movie and TV show information from [TheMovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The application is similar to the Android MovieApp that is also in this repository, it is just written in Ruby on Rails and not Java.

The develpoment is still in the early stages with no major frontend design, other than a navbar and simple panel to display the parsed JSON data.

At the moment the app can display several sections that are called from TheMovieDB such as popular movie and popular TV shows. Each movie and TV show can then be expanded to display additional information. In the current state it only show minimal information as the focus has been to get the API calls working and to parse the data correctly.

In progress is the search function in the app.

**Sample screenshots**

This is a simple preview of the site, without any fronend work. The program just prints a few of many parameters that are available with the specific API call.

The screenshots will be updated as the app is developed.
